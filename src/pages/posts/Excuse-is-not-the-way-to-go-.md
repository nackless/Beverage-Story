If you have failed at doing something, don't find a excuse. That will only make you fail again. That will only hamper your personal growth. Excuses are for losers.

The first step is to accept that there is a problem, it can be you, someone else or the system. Find that problem and solve it.

That's the only way you will ever be successful. Make a note of why you failed.

Don't delay tasks beyond their deadline, this will only make you more sad in the long run. Use Parkinson's law, this will give you an edge over your competition.
