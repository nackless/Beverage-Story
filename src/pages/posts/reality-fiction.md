As a species, humans have undeniably asserted their dominance over the planet, establishing complex societies that are often divided along the lines of economic status, religion, caste, color, and ethnicity. These divisions, constructs of our own making, paint a paradoxical picture of a species that has risen to the apex of the food chain while simultaneously entangling itself in conflicts born of its own creation.

<br />
Across generations, humankind has experienced leaps of progress, stumbling upon groundbreaking advancements in science, literature, and technology. These achievements, which at times appear nothing short of miraculous, are the fruits of human ingenuity, creativity, and relentless pursuit of knowledge. Yet, despite the profound nature of this progress, our minds are curiously conditioned to perceive these feats as ordinary, to accept them as the natural course of human development, without fully grasping their true significance.

<br />
<br />
In moments of introspection, I have found myself questioning whether this grand narrative of human progress and unity is, in fact, an illusion. Could it be that we are not a singular species united in purpose, but rather a collection of disparate entities, coexisting uneasily on this planet? Is it possible that the so-called "dominant" class depends on the marginalized for their own sense of superiority, for their labor, and for the comfort that their privilege affords?

<br />
<br />
While I cannot offer definitive proof, this perspective seems to resonate with many of the realities we observe in society. The system of law and order, which ostensibly exists to uphold justice, frequently appears skewed in favor of the wealthy and powerful. A minor infraction by a person of lesser means can result in harsh punishment, while those with wealth and influence often evade consequences for even the most egregious offenses.

<br />
<br />
The underprivileged are forced into a relentless struggle for basic necessities, while the privileged enjoy a life of abundance and security. It is often argued that those who are wealthy have earned their status through hard work and determination. But is every effort rewarded equally in this world? They say luck plays a significant role in one's success, but I suspect that there is a more profound, underlying system at play—one that perpetuates inequality and disparity, one that is carefully hidden beneath layers of social norms and justifications.

<br />
<br />
I do not claim to have all the answers, nor do I wish to impose a singular worldview. However, I can no longer remain silent about these thoughts. It is time we challenge the dominant narratives, question the so-called truths we've been fed, and seek a more honest and nuanced understanding of our world and our place within it.
