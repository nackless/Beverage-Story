We all struggle with things getting delayed and deadlines not getting achieved. Waking up in the morning to going to bed, depending on the stage of life you are in, you might have a lot of very little time.

I have struggled with getting things done and life has always managed to slow me down. I can call it headwinds or my own lack of commitment but at the end, I am the one who suffered.

To get myself on track, I changed just one thing in my life and everything seemed to fall back in place.

START......  And do that one thing every day. It does not matter for how long. What matters is consistency and yes, having a deadline in mind. Yes, there are lots of other things that can potentially be added but they all happen only if you start. So, make this one change and you will see the magic.
